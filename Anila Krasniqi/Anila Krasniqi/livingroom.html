              <h3>Minimalist Style</h3>
              <p>Minimalist living room design is for you if you want a design that is impactful and anything but boring. Why? Because minimalist design is all about restraint, so rather than looking at a space that is missing something, it’s more about the effect of what is left out of the design. Clutter-free surfaces, clean-lined furniture and color palettes that are soothing to the eye make this design style so visually pleasing.When designing a minimalist living room, striking a balance between sparsity and too much is key.</p>

              <h3>Modern Style</h3>
              <p>Modern design, though often confused with contemporary style, is a distinct style within itself. Modern style design is inspired by the early 20th century, while contemporary is always evolving.The decor is minimal and colors are neutral, but this doesn't mean that modern style lacks any bit of warmth and personality.Modern style is made up of elements that celebrate natural materials, neutral tones, and the absence of ornate detailing. It is simple, but it is impactful in its stature.  </p>

              <h3>Rustic Style</h3>
              <p>A living room is just that; a space where we live! It’s used for a multitude of needs, from TV watching, family game nights, gathering of friends, solo reading afternoons and everything in between. This means a living room needs to be both beautiful and functional. A sofa should be both something you enjoy looking at, and something you enjoy cuddling up in on a cold day! For those reasons, we can’t think of a cozier style than Rustic.</p>
